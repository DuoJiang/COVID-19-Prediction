# Predicting the COVID-19 Confirmed Cases

This is a final project for the course GA-DS 1003 Introduction to Machine Learning at NYU in response to the global spread of COVID-19 virus.

The following is a detailed description of files in this repository:

* [Merge_to_Full_Dataset_git.ipynb](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/Merge_to_Full_Dataset_git.ipynb) takes in the processed dataset [riskCalculated_confirmed_cases_moving_average_v0517_v2.csv](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/data/riskCalculated_confirmed_cases_moving_average_v0517_v2.csv), [cum_death_recover_update_05_08.csv](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/data/cum_death_recover_update_05_08.csv), [hospital.csv](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/data/hospital.csv) and [population_density_by_county.csv](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/data/population_density_by_county.csv) and merges them all together to get the final dataset we used for modeling.

* [ERF error function.ipynb](https://github.com/JiaruiTang/DS1003-Predicting-the-COVID-19-Cases/blob/master/ERF error function.ipynb)
